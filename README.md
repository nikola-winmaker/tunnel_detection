Using acoustic features and classification algorithms to distinguish between road and tunnel signatures.

Use acoustic phenomena of the sudden change in an acoustic environment. In order to achieve this, an externally mounted acoustic pressure sensor proves to be suitable. 
The driver, when listening to the aural landscape before and after the tunnel, may not be consciously aware of the tunnel's size or any specific internal characteristics. However, the presence of a tunnel is clearly perceivable throughout its entire length, with the driver's reaction time (i.e., resolution) determined by the capabilities of the human auditory system.

Surface-mounted pressure microphone 147AX was used to record audio samples, as it is optimized for testing in the automotive industry. It combines the high precision and stability of a laboratory microphone with a high level of ruggedness, including the ability to function properly in the most challenging environment with vibrations, oil mists, water spray and dirt and dust - and high temperatures up to 125Â°C. Microphone design and other internal parts makes it resilient to shock and vibrations. It functions well under conditions with vibrations and g-forces from uneven road surfaces and other sudden directional shifts as encountered in real-life driving tests.
